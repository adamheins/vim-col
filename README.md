# vim-liner
The simplest of vim plugins. Provides the command `:Col <column>` to set the
colorcolumn and textwidth. Useful when you work with codebases that have
different line limits.

## Install
Use the vim plugin manager of your choice. If you don't currently use a vim plugin manager, I recommend [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

## License
MIT license. See the LICENSE file.
